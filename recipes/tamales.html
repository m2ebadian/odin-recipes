    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>Tamales are a traditional Mesoamerican dish made of masa (corn dough) that is steamed in a corn husk or banana leaf. They are filled with a variety of ingredients, such as meats, cheeses, fruits, or vegetables. Tamales are a staple in many Latin American cuisines and are often served during celebrations and holidays.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups masa harina</li>
        <li>1/2 cup lard or vegetable shortening</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded chicken or pork</li>
        <li>1/2 cup red chili sauce</li>
        <li>20 dried corn husks, soaked in warm water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix masa harina, baking powder, and salt. Add lard and mix until crumbly. Gradually add chicken broth until the dough has a soft, spreadable consistency.</li>
        <li>In another bowl, mix shredded chicken or pork with red chili sauce.</li>
        <li>Lay out a soaked corn husk and spread a thin layer of masa dough in the center. Add a spoonful of the meat mixture on top.</li>
        <li>Fold the sides of the corn husk over the filling, then fold the bottom up and tie with a strip of husk if needed.</li>
        <li>Place tamales upright in a steamer and steam for 1-1.5 hours, or until the masa is firm and easily separates from the husk.</li>
        <li>Let tamales cool slightly before serving. Serve with additional chili sauce if desired.</li>
    </ol>
